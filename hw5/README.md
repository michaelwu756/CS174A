Assignment 5 is worth 0 points (as announced).  But you should do it anyway, because it just provides your team with a bunch of free code.

Directions:  Host the folder and open localhost as always.  Open Developer Tools and create a workspace for your new folder.  Now you can edit the files, which is necessary to view the different demos.

To select a demo, open and edit main-scene.js.  Assign your choice to the Main_Scene variable.  Your choices for scenes are:

* Minimal_Webgl_Demo
* Axes_Viewer_Test_Scene
* Inertia_Demo
* Collision_Demo
* Many_Lights_Demo
* Obj_File_Demo
* Scene_To_Texture_Demo
* Text_Demo
* Transforms_Sandbox

The code comments in each file should help, as should the explanations the demos print on the page.  Enjoy!
